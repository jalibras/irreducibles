This folder contains the results of the search. Each subfolder is named according to the number of vertices of the graphs. For example five/ contains graphs5.json which contains the data for all (2,2)-tight graphs with 5 vertices, and ors5.json which contains data for all the irreducible (2,2)-tight torus graphs with 5 vertices. The data in seven is stored a little differently due to the large number of graphs, see the README file in that folder. The data in four/ was entered by hand as the starting point for the search.
